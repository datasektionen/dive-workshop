# Sprite Animation Studio

## Goal
Build a simple sprite animator with multiple frames and playback controls.

## Difficulty
Medium

## Estimated Time
60-100 minutes

## What you will build
- Frame data structure for pixel art.
- Playback loop with frame index and FPS control.
- Basic controls: play, pause, loop, speed.

## Concepts to practice
- Lists of frames (2D RGB arrays).
- Frame indexing and wraparound.
- Small editor-like utility functions.
- Config-driven design.

## Suggested steps
1. Define 3-6 animation frames manually in code.
2. Render current frame and increment index by timer.
3. Add playback toggles and speed variable.
4. Add a preview function for one-shot play.

## Stretch goals
- Add crossfade between frames.
- Add mirrored playback (forward then reverse).
- Add named animations (idle, blink, celebrate).

## Success criteria
- Animation timing is stable.
- Frame data is easy to maintain.
- Controls work without breaking loop.
