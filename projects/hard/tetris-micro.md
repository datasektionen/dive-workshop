# Tetris Micro

## Goal
Create a compact Tetris-like game adapted to an 8x8 board.

## Difficulty
Hard

## Estimated Time
3-5 hours

## What you will build
- Piece definitions and rotation.
- Gravity ticks and lock behavior.
- Line clear detection and collapse.
- Score system based on clears.

## Concepts to practice
- Rotation math and collision checks.
- Immutable-style board updates.
- Tick-based simulation loop.
- Complexity management in game logic.

## Suggested steps
1. Define a small set of pieces (2-4 shapes).
2. Implement movement and collision guardrails.
3. Lock pieces and clear full rows.
4. Add score + game-over state.

## Stretch goals
- Add hold piece feature.
- Add preview of next piece.
- Add level speed progression.

## Success criteria
- Piece movement/rotation is predictable.
- Clear logic never corrupts board.
- Game-over state triggers correctly.
