# Snake With Autopilot

## Goal
Implement Snake on the 8x8 matrix with optional autopilot pathfinding mode.

## Difficulty
Hard

## Estimated Time
2-4 hours

## What you will build
- Full snake game loop.
- Food spawning and growth logic.
- Collision detection.
- Optional autopilot that chooses safe moves.

## Concepts to practice
- Grid-based game architecture.
- Queue/list operations for snake body.
- Path planning heuristics.
- Preventing impossible states.

## Suggested steps
1. Build manual snake movement and collisions first.
2. Add food spawn rules that avoid snake cells.
3. Add scoring and restart flow.
4. Add autopilot mode that picks shortest safe path.

## Stretch goals
- Add speed increase per score.
- Add obstacle mode.
- Add replay of final run.

## Success criteria
- Snake gameplay is reliable.
- No overlap bugs in body updates.
- Autopilot survives longer than random movement.
