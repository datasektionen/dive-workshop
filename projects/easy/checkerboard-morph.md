# Checkerboard Morph

## Goal
Build an animation that morphs from one checkerboard pattern to another color pattern.

## Difficulty
Easy

## Estimated Time
30-45 minutes

## What you will build
- A checkerboard pattern generator.
- A timed transition between two color themes.
- A continuous loop that alternates between states.

## Concepts to practice
- Modulo math (`(x + y) % 2`).
- State toggling.
- Transition timing.
- Clean loop structure for animation frames.

## Suggested steps
1. Render a basic checkerboard with two colors.
2. Add a timer/counter to switch between theme A and B.
3. Add a short fade step by scaling RGB values.
4. Loop forever with consistent frame delay.

## Stretch goals
- Add diagonal wave distortion on top.
- Add a third theme and cycle through all three.
- Make checker size configurable (1x1 or 2x2 blocks).

## Success criteria
- Pattern is correct and stable.
- Theme transitions are clearly visible.
- Code is organized into small functions.
